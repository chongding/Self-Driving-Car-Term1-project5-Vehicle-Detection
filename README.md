# Self-Driving-Car-Term1-project5-Vehicle-Detection
The goal of this project is to detect vehicles in a video stream with a traditional machine learning method (Support Vector Machine). 
Code files:
Utilities.py: contain all the helper functions such as color_hist, extract_features, find_cars etc.
Feature_train.py: feature training and parameter tuning
Image_test.py: drawing b-boxs on example images
Vehicle_det.py: video process 
Feature_parm.pkl: pickle file contains all the parameters as well as the SVM and X_scaler etc.
parameter_tuning.xlsx: parameter tuning results
